Consumer (referred "my dear") 
Can do with dis shit whatever they wish 
As long as my dear is not wealthy-ish

If else is the case (referred "rich bastard")
Consider donation and kindly send faster
As long as we see the moneys comes in
Rich bastard forgiven the previous sin

You can distribute and may even resell
As long as you share the income as well
If sharing the margin does not ring a bell
My lawyers will sue till you see prison cell

Oh well I shall stop enough of bullshit
If you not a fucker no doubt you will fit
I have to admit this license is leet
Just feeling few lines I had overdid
